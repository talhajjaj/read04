-CONTENT LAYER :
. html files
This is where the content of
the page lives. The HTML gives
the page structure and adds
semantics. 
-PRESENTATION LAYER :
. css files
The CSS enhances the HTML
page with rules that state how
the HTML content is presented
(backgrounds, borders, box
dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.).

-BEHAVIOR LAYER
.js files
This is where we can change
how the page behaves, adding
interactivity. We will aim to keep
as much of our JavaScript as
possible in separate files

These three layers form the basis of a popular
approach to building web pages called
progressive enhancement. 

If we want to speak simply about Html ,CSS and JS :
so HTML  it focus on the content.
CSS focus on the page looks .
and JS  is added last
and enhances the usability of
the page or the experience of
interacting with the site.
 So we concluded that HTML, CSS, JS languages ​​depend on each other to get a suitable web page.

 **How to creat A JavaScript file ?**
A javascript file is just a text file ,like HTML and CSS
files are.
you can write it in HTML in the end of the </body> , in the <script> tag just write :
<script>//then the varible or the js code </script> .. its a comment .
or  you can just creat a folder for js and file inside it to wrote in js language then linked it with HTML page and this is the better way.
