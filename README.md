# JavaScript & jQuery

-CONTENT LAYER :
. html files
This is where the content of
the page lives. The HTML gives
the page structure and adds
semantics. 
-PRESENTATION LAYER :
. css files
The CSS enhances the HTML
page with rules that state how
the HTML content is presented
(backgrounds, borders, box
dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.).

-BEHAVIOR LAYER
.js files
This is where we can change
how the page behaves, adding
interactivity. We will aim to keep
as much of our JavaScript as
possible in separate files

These three layers form the basis of a popular
approach to building web pages called
progressive enhancement. 

If we want to speak simply about Html ,CSS and JS :
so HTML  it focus on the content.
CSS focus on the page looks .
and JS  is added last
and enhances the usability of
the page or the experience of
interacting with the site.
 So we concluded that HTML, CSS, JS languages ​​depend on each other to get a suitable web page.

 **How to creat A JavaScript file ?**
A javascript file is just a text file ,like HTML and CSS
files are.
you can write it in HTML in the end of the </body> , in the <script> tag just write :
<script>//then the varible or the js code </script> .. its a comment .
or  you can just creat a folder for js and file inside it to wrote in js language then linked it with HTML page and this is the better way.

there is some roles and grammer for js :

-You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code. 
to write a comment just add // this forward slash .
 
 -its should have a variables a script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables,
and when you assigned a value to a variable, you can then
change what is stored in the variable later in the same script.

**so how to give the variables a value ?**
once you have created a variable , you can store in it the information that you want , example :

this is the variable name : age
and this is a variable value : 20
age = 20

there is atypes of data :
- NUMERIC DATA TYPE : to handle numbers such : 4 , 55
-STRING DATA TYPE  :its consist  letters you can add quots but you should be attentive, These can be single or double quotes, but the opening quote , its means that you must match the closing quot.
-BOOLEAN DATA TYPE :Boolean data types can have one
of two values: true or false.
